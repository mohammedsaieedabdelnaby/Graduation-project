### Project Overview

Our graduation project focuses on simplifying and enhancing content creation using AI technology. We have developed two core applications:

1. **Content Flow** – A sophisticated AI Writing Assistant built on Llama 3.2 3B, enabling users to generate custom content through prompt engineering. The application supports customizable text generation, catering to a variety of writing tasks such as research papers, essays, cover letters, and more.
   
2. **Inspire AI** – A prompt optimizer designed to improve AI image model outputs. By refining user inputs, it enhances the quality of AI-generated images for models like Stable Diffusion and Flux.

### Why It Matters

We aim to make AI technologies more accessible and customizable for users, bridging the gap between technical advancements and creative processes. Our tools help users generate high-quality written content and optimized prompts for AI-based image generation, reducing the complexity of these tasks.

### Methodology

- **Content Flow:** Utilizes Llama 3.2 3B to assist with natural language generation through prompt engineering. Users input desired tone, style, and content type, while the system generates tailored text.
  
- **Inspire AI:** Leverages NLP techniques to optimize prompts for image models. It offers improved image quality and accuracy through better prompt formulation.

### Key Features

- **Custom AI Writing Assistant**: Adjust tone, style, and structure for personalized content.
- **AI Prompt Optimizer**: Enhances AI-generated images by refining user inputs and prompts.
  
### Technologies Used

- **AI Writing Assistant:** Python, Hugging Face, Llama models.
- **Prompt Optimizer:** NLP frameworks, Llama model, Llava API integrations.

### Challenges & Results

- **Challenges:** Ensuring model accuracy and managing computational resources for real-time optimizations.
- **Results:** Faster content creation and improved AI-generated image quality, enhancing user experience in both applications.
